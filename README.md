# Path-Finding-Visualizer


My most recent project involved the expansion of a pathfinding visualizer created by TechwithTim (video linked at the end.) My additions include: 
-adding Dijkstra's algorithm
-adding greedy best-first algorithm
- adding a way to clear board of open and closed nodes to allow user to try out a different algorithm on board they already made
-fix bug: made it impossible to put the end node where the start node is
-added title screen to explain controls
